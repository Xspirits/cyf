Hello redditors!

For the past weeks I have been developing a new web-app which aim to offer a new way to enjoy the game we use to play.

The concept: launch and receive challenges from other gamer on any game, any platform. 

** of course, this concept is great with FFXIV as grinding, speedruning are easily implementable !**

Challenges are a way to add excitement to gaming, and can be either easy or hard. Cyf (challenge your friends) has been designed to allow everyone enjoying challenges from casual to hardcore gamer.

**Principles/actions**

Once the account is created the player can find new persons to challenges on the challengers list. It's important to add friends on the site as this is a requirement to launch & receive challenges.

Create challenges:

* Select a title
* Select a game
* Describe the challenge (see how to validate them below)
* Select the allowed time frame (Hours and//or days)

Launch challenges:

* Select an existing challenge
* Pick a friend
* Launch :D

Accept challenges:

* Simply accept or deny oncoming challenges.

Validate challenges:

* Once completed, the player who have been challenged must submit a proof (minimum 1 screenshot)
* The person who launched the challenge has to look at the proof and decide to validate or not the challenge.

> **What if I am misjudged?** players can submit the case to a tribunal of 3 players picked randomly who will be asked to review the case. If they decide you deserve to succeed your challenge, then it will validate your ongoing (the case/challenge).
 
I have been playing for years, and this looks as a good opportunity to have fun on game I don't really use anymore or even on new games!

** For who? which game? **

Cyf will work on any existing game (among our current game list) where you can create challenges and take proves. 

We can easily think of some type of challenges such as, but not limited to:

* Speedrun
* Grinding
* Building
* Gathering
* Quests
* and so on

What's great, again, is that **you create the challenges**: so you can make a challenge for your friend (level from 0 to 10 in 3 hours on game X) for example. Then, people will be able to pick your challenge to use it, too, if they want.

**Proves**

We don't have many options to offer trustworthy proves of achievements, so players must submit at least One screenshot (up to 2 + a commentary). For some games like League of Legend it will be possible in a near future to create a server-side validation's check through the provided api, but not yet.

**What about the quality/difficulty of the challenges? How do we filter them ?**

Once a challenge is completed, players are asked to evaluate and rate their experience with this challenges. The more the challenge are evaluated the more they could be valuated. As challenge take off and gain value, people who are able to complete them will then gain bonus experience points.

**Your place**

It's important to provide more than just a list of challenges, so here are some features already working:

* Level system 
* Experience system
* Ladders: daily/weekly/monthly and global!
* Select games you play, thus players can challenge you on theses
* Facebook & Twitter account linking
* Link a league of legend account
* Easy/automatic sharing on FB/Twitter: when you levelup/complete a challenge/get ranked (can be disabled in settings seamlessly)

**So, what's next?**

I am now here to ask if some person would accept to try the website and provide some feedback about what they like/dislike or things they want to point out.
This is an **entirely free** system, we're just here to provide fun and bring new things!

There is a lot to do, but first things are:

* Create challenges on your favorites games
* Invite your friends or find people around you to give a try to cyf!

If you feel like giving a try, please head to : [Challenge your friends](http://www.cyf-app.co)

Here are some contacts infos:

===================================
**TL;DR**: I created [Challenge your friends](http://www.cyf-app.co): a project where you can receive and launch challenges on any games and any platform to find back or discover new ways to enjoy your favorites games. I am looking for some feedback from players in order to improve the project!
